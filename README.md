# SAFE Pocket: Easily accessing your personal items privately, safely and globally

## Introduction
As a traveller you need to carry a few personal items that you cannot loose if you want to be able to access your money, e.g. credit cards and homebanking passwords, or perhaps you crypto-wallets keys.
This can be sometimes challenging since you may not want to leave them at the hotel/hostel, but if you otherwise carry them with you it can also be risky or just uncomfortable.
In addition to this, if you are booking things as you travel (e.g. as a backpacker), you need to use your passwords and credit card numbers on a daily basis, and you are requested to type your passwords, and specially, your credit card numbers over and over again, unless you decide to risk it and store them in your mobile phone or trust any cloud storage to keep them there, which in any case is not a good idea.

## Background
As mentioned above, many people decide to store their credit card numbers and/or passwords in their mobile, tablet, laptop, or email accounts, so they can easily access them when needed, like when booking things online laying down very comfortably on the bed whilst your wallet and personal items are inside a locker and not with you in that moment.
The first thing that comes up to anyone's mind when thinking of how to solve this issue is to store this information in a text file, which you can then encrypt and upload to any of the cloud services available today, including an email account. This sounds reasonable, and probably fairly secure, although it's definitely not a good choice if you want it to be easy to maintain and to retrieve the information you stored. In order to retrieve the information you need to first download the encrypted file, which implies logging into the cloud service where you stored it, you then need to decrypt it, then open it with a text editor to finally be able to read or copy/paste the information you were looking for.

## Solution
In order to solve this problem, it's proposed to develop a web application deployed on the SAFE network which provides an extremely simple and easy to use UI to manage this type of information, which takes care of storing the data securely on the user's SAFE account.
By providing such an application, the user would only need to make sure it has a SAFE account and the SAFE browser installed in its mobile phone, tablet or laptop. All the encryption/decryption tasks are automatically handled by SAFE, and the web application displays the information so it can be copied/pasted, as well as edited, in a very friendly way.
